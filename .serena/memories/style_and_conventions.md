- Language: Bash.
- Safety flags: scripts consistently use `set -euo pipefail`.
- Style: small helper functions for repeated logic (`log`, etc.), explicit guard checks before installs.
- Behavior expectation: scripts should be idempotent and safe to rerun after VM recycle with persistent disk.
- Service integration: systemd oneshot service for boot-time checks.
